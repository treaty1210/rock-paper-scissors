## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The setTimeout function was pretty useful. Also, the logic behind rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock required some more effort to apply. Learning about how to set up the items to display and hide when needed is a useful technique that I will be using more often in the future. 

### Useful resources

- [Radial Gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients_radial.asp) - This helped me figure out the syntax for radial gradients. 
- [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) - This is an article taught me how to create a delay for my function. I think I will be using this more often in the future when needed.
- [Z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This helped in creating the pop-up.
